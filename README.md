Just a project to train class method

Hi everyone!

I made a calculator that has some tricks that can help you if you interesting...

1# 
The Calculator has a function ($) to select the query and decide if it's a node or a element.

2#
Click event has the same easy way, also a automatic selection method of the class in the declaration, for example:

class.onClick(element, method) <-- it will get the method of the class;

3#
The Calculator has a animation too, i made with setTimeout because the animation has 0.3s... i didn't know what should be the best way to do this... just to practice :)

4#
The display automatic put a dot if it's is a thousand (Brazilian standard) and a ',' to split integer to decimal numbers (thank you DevSimplified for this).

Thank you for reading and sory if my english is not very well as it should be.
